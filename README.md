# Graph Library
A graph header file implementing basic types of graphs and some algorithms


## Description
- A Graph library (a partial implementation of CS 97SI) in C++ for Python
- Supports graph traversal(BFS & DFS), does Topological Sort, finds the Shortest Path Tree using Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Checks for Eulerian Circuit, Hamiltonian Path, SCC using Kosaraju’s algorithm
