# Graph Library
A graph header file implementing basic types of graphs and some algorithms


## Description
- A graph library for Python in C/C++
- Supports graph traversal, does Topological Sort, finds the Shortest Path Tree using Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Checks for Eulerian Circuit, Hamiltonian Path, SCC using Kosaraju’s algorithm
